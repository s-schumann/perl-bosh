Bugs
----

### XMPP

- Sometimes delay (up to 10 minutes) in sending messages.

- Check authorization again. Some users seem to appear online with NONE authorization. Might be problem of client (directed presence).

- Timeout for network disconnected users. They should appear offline sooner.
	Answer: Ping possible. Some clients do not support it and go offline.

### Perl daemon

- Online sometimes replaced by new connection. No real identification of online and still-online yet. Should be modified.
